# Seislerd√ºtsches W√∂rterbuech

The goal of this project is to create a digital version of the popular book. It is not intended to replace the print version but rather to offer additional features and help to print future versions.

## Quick start

After cloning the repository you need to create a `.env` file.

```
cp .env.defaults .env
```

You then have to set a password for the admin user of the Elasticsearch container. You can do this by uncommenting the last line in the new `.env` file and set a password for`ELASTIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>`.

That's it. Now you can run everything locally with Docker.

```
docker compose up elasticsearch proxy backend
```

The first time it might take a few minutes to download all the images. After everything is up and running you need to initially setup the words in the elastic container by calling `http://localhost:8001/elastic-reset`. You can use `http://localhost:8001/elastic-health` to check if Elasticsearch is ready. If yes it should return that it's health and status is green.

After that you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:4202`.
